### Stream Workflow
1. **Admin or Model** uses `/streamcreate` to register stream

3. **DM sent to model** (not command user) with stream details
4. **Role pinged** in plain text for notifications (if specified)
5. **Creator pinged** in embed (if specified)
6. **Automated reminder** 1 day before due date
7. **Model uses** `/completestream` when finished
8. **Stream archived** and kept for 7 days before automatic cleanup
9. **Officers can use** `/cleanup` to manually clean old streams

## ‚ú¶ Customization for Your Server ‚ú¶

### Channel Names
The bot looks for these channel patterns:
- `stream-tracker` or `„Äéstream-tracker„Äè` - For stream logs and reminders
- `completed-streams` - For archived completed streams

### Permissions Setup
For officer-only commands:
- Assign "Manage Messages" permission to officer roles for `/activestreams`, `/cleanup`
- Assign "Manage Roles" permission for `/reactionrole` commands
- Assign "Kick Members" permission for `/kick` command
- Assign "Ban Members" permission for `/ban` command
- Or use Discord's slash command permissions in Server Settings

### Admin/Model Flexibility
The bot supports flexible stream creation:
- **Models can create** their own streams (default behavior)
- **Admins can create** streams for models using the `model` parameter
- **DMs are sent** to the model, not the command user
- **Role pinging** for Stream Officers in plain text
- **Creator pinging** in embed for recognition

### Auto-Moderation Configuration
Configure automated moderation features:
- **Spam Protection**: Automatic timeout for repeated messages
- **Link Filtering**: Block or allow links based on server rules
- **Mention Limits**: Prevent mention spam
- **Bad Word Detection**: Filter inappropriate content
- **Whitelist System**: Exempt channels/users from auto-moderation

### Level System Customization
- **XP Rewards**: Set custom XP amounts for different activities
- **Role Rewards**: Assign roles for reaching specific levels
- **Leaderboard Display**: Customize how rankings are shown
- **Level Requirements**: Adjust XP requirements for level progression

### Database Management
- **Automatic cleanup** of completed streams after 7 days
- **Manual cleanup** commands for officers
- **Duplicate prevention** with interaction tracking
- **Efficient storage** to stay within free tier limits
- **Statistics tracking** for performance monitoring

## ‚ú¶ Deployment ‚ú¶

### For Production Servers
1. Use environment variables for secrets (never commit tokens)
2. Set up proper database backups
3. Monitor bot uptime and logs
4. Consider using PM2 or Docker for process management

### Scaling for Multiple Servers
The bot is designed to work across multiple Discord servers:
- All data is scoped by `serverId`
- Each server maintains independent streams, moderation logs, and statistics
- User data is tracked per server with separate level systems
- Auto-moderation settings are server-specific
- Reaction roles work independently per server

## ‚ú¶ Support ‚ú¶

### Common Issues
- **Bot not responding**: Check Discord token and bot permissions
- **Database errors**: Verify DATABASE_URL and run `npm run db:push`
- **Command not found**: Ensure bot has "Use Slash Commands" permission

### Bot Philosophy
> "Astraee embodies structure as beauty. She preserves the dignity of streaming, ensuring fairness, recognition, and accountability. Her voice celebrates elegance in order, and order in creativity."

‚ùñ "Order transforms creativity into legacy." ‚ùñ
